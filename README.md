# Learn ramda, the interactive way

When I was learning/using ramda I found really helpful [https://github.com/ramda/ramda/wiki/What-Function-Should-I-Use](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/wiki/What-Function-Should-I-Use) since the [Ramda documentation](http://ramdajs.com/docs/) were just a list of the methods and crazy examples.

So I decided to create a nice little UI to interactively find the method that works for you.

Ramda might be intimidating for newcomers, since there are many concepts that are involved from Functional
Programming. I would recommend to take a look at [hemanth/functional-programming-jargon](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon)

## Thanks

- Kudos to [Sarah Drasner](https://github.com/sdras) for inspire me with: https://sdras.github.io/array-explorer
- Kudos to [Stefano Vozza](https://github.com/svozza) for creating all the documentation! https://github.com/ramda/ramda/wiki/What-Function-Should-I-Use

## I need some help

I want to improve the example code snippets. Inside `/src/data.js` contains all the data related with the website. You will see that there are many "methods" that don't have any code.

I would love that you [suggest](https://github.com/davesnx/learn-ramda/issues/new) some code examples for some methods that found you useful. And hopefully some day we could improve the official docs!

## Want to run it locally?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can learn more in their [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
