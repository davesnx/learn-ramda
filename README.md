## Why

Ramda might be intimidating for newcomers, so I wanted to create a tool to help!

## Thanks

- Kudos to [Sarah Drasner](https://github.com/sdras) for inspire me with: https://sdras.github.io/array-explorer
- Kudos to [Stefano Vozza](https://github.com/svozza) for creating all the documentation! https://github.com/ramda/ramda/wiki/What-Function-Should-I-Use
