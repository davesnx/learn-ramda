# Learn ramda, the interactive way

When I was learning/using ramda I found really helpful [https://github.com/ramda/ramda/wiki/What-Function-Should-I-Use](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/wiki/What-Function-Should-I-Use) since the [Ramda documentation](http://ramdajs.com/docs/) were just a list of the methods and crazy examples.

So I decided to create a nice little UI to interactively find the method that works for you.

Ramda might be intimidating for newcomers, since there are many concepts that are involved from Functional
Programming. I would recommend to take a look at [hemanth/functional-programming-jargon](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon)
